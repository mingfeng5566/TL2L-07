        <h1>How will be life without IOT devices such as smartphone?</h1>
        <p>I decided to conduct a social experiment by going without a phone for a day because teenagers today are glued to their technology.So I started this experiment last week.My daily ritual was ready to begin, and I had put my phone in the locker.I usually watch Tiktok or check my WhatsApp as soon as I get up, but that particular day was a little different because I didn't have my phone with me.I got out of bed, finished my morning chores, and then sat down in the hall.I began reading the book my mother had bought me months before since I was so bored.I was surprised to find the story entertaining since I'm not typically a reader.I literally finish reading the book's first few pages.Wow! Quite fascinating, huh? I agree to the fact that even I experienced the same.I then observed that my grandma was having trouble with her cooking, so I assisted her by chopping the veggies and kept her company.Following that, I ate lunch.I frequently scan through Instagram clips while eating, which sometimes makes me feel relieved.However, that particular day, I was able to look through reels since I was spending time with my adorable brother.Most of the notable happenings from our school years were discussed.We were catching on our buddies about all the good times we had.Sharing things with him was wonderful.I sensed an improvement of our relationship.I didn't know what to do after lunch, so I performed some housework like sweeping, mopping, and other things.Since I won't always clean it, I also clean my room.My mother was stunned to find me completing all the tasks.I then had a brief nap.I didn't know what to do when I woke up because it should have been time to contact my friends as usual, but since I didn't have my phone with me, I called my mother and brother and asked them to play badminton at the next court instead.Thus, we warmed up before beginning to play.Although I don't practise sports, badminton is one of my favourites, so after a while, I began to like playing.We then returned home and had a shower.I wanted to spend time with my father as he was just getting home from work.At our dinner table, we all shared a meal.We exchanged several stories with one another.To be really honest, it was the finest night since I got to spend quality time with my family and share a lot of things.Despite the fact that phones are crucial to us, we must set aside time for our families.</p>

        <p>As per the collected data we can conclude or gather some information. As per the information gathered, when we cover the phone with a China material the Bluetooth transmission speed faster for example it just takes 13.59 minutes compare to the other material such as plastic, stainless, wood and iron. Moreover, when it comes to distance after 6 meter the connection is unconnectable.</p>

        <h2>Why distance and different materials affect Bluetooth speed?</h2>
        <p>Path loss refers to the reduction in signal strength of radio waves as they propagate through the air. Path loss, or path attenuation, naturally occurs with distance and is influenced by the signal transmission environment. Obstacles between the transmitter and receiver can disrupt the signal. Attenuators can be anything from humidity and precipitation, to walls, windows, and other obstacles made of glass, wood, metal, or concrete, including metal towers or panels that reflect and scatter radio waves. While radio waves can pass through objects, the amount of attenuation and effective path loss varies with the type and density of the obstacle.</p>

    <h1>How’s life after technology?</h1>
    <p>Everyone is aware that technology in our world is advancing.At the same time our life is getting more easier after the technology so i came up with a question which is How is life after technology? For further details and information i wanted to get some opinion from everyone so i choose to do interview though google form.As the result i got 19 responses from my friends.As the first question which is How much time do you spend on the phone and computer daily.Many of them responded that its more than 6 hours.Ya nowadays even adult is spending their free time in social media so do as the teenagers.Next question is Which apps takes most time in your daily routine? As the result i got to know it’s social media.Social media is the most entertainment app since it contains TikTok,Instagram,Facebook and so on.Other than that next question is what do you prefer phone or computer? Of course the answer is phone due the weight compare to the computer which is heavier than a normal phone.And its easier to carry as everyone dont need to bring their computer everywhere.Lastly which you prefer work from home or work from office? Recently during MCO everyone convenient working from home because we can avoid the jam and we can work what time we want.So in this we can know the result would be work from .homepage{
    background-image: url('https://images.pexels.com/photos/66278/sunrise-ocean-sea-water-66278.jpeg').As a conclusion the world is fully taken by the technology and the upcoming generation will be having easier lifestyle than us </p>
